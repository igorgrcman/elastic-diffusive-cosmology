# v17.49.000 — Epistemic Unification (Golden Standard)

Date: 2026-01-09

Scope: **no new physics**. Editorial/rigor-only changes to enforce a single epistemic standard.

## Summary
- `main.tex`: includes `EDC_EPISTEMIC_STANDARD.tex` as a single source of truth.
- `appendix_c_logical_structure.tex`: removed conflicting legend (`C = Conjecture`, `R = Recovered Result`).
  - Conjectures are now **P = Proposed**; recovered items are classified as **D = Derived** (role “Recovered” stated in text).
  - Renamed conjecture IDs from `C1..` to `K1..` to avoid collision with Calibration.
- `chapter_7_gravity.tex`: softened language where full derivations are not shown (reframed as “proposed expression + consistency check”).
  - Renamed “EDC Resolution (Conjecture)” → “(Proposed)”.
