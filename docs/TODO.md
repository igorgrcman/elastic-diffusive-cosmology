# TODO.md — EDC_Project Workspace Actions

**Last updated:** 2026-01-28

---

## Priority 1: Infrastructure (Blocking)

- [x] Create workspace-level CANON_BUNDLE.md (2026-01-28)
- [x] Create WORKSPACE_MAP.md (2026-01-28)
- [x] Create CONCEPT_INDEX.md (2026-01-28)
- [x] Create root STATUS.md (2026-01-28)
- [x] Create root TODO.md (2026-01-28)
- [x] Create root CLAUDE.md with workspace canon enforcement (2026-01-28)
- [x] Update SESSION_LOG.md (2026-01-28)

---

## Priority 2: Book 2 Blocking Issues

- [ ] **Resolve L_0/delta tension** — Why static prefers pi^2, dynamic prefers 9.33?
- [ ] **Derive prefactor A** from fluctuation determinant (currently [Cal])
- [ ] **Derive G_F** without circular input (currently uses measured v)

---

## Priority 3: Model Completion

- [ ] Derive geometric factor f = sqrt(delta/L_0) from first principles
- [ ] Derive frustration energy epsilon_f(A) from 5D action
- [ ] Include spin/isospin in topological pinning model

---

## Priority 4: Documentation

- [ ] Audit all "<1%" vs "~20%" claims for consistency
- [ ] Update turning points with frustration-corrected G-N law
- [ ] Complete Companion N (Neutron backbone) — plan ready in CANON_BUNDLE Section 14

---

## Priority 5: Extensions

- [ ] Connect topological pinning to drip lines
- [ ] Test superheavy predictions against experimental data
- [ ] Investigate QCD duality (is topological pinning dual to lattice QCD?)

---

## Completed (Recent)

- [x] Workspace canon infrastructure (2026-01-28)

- [x] Red team patches: precision consistency (2026-01-28)
- [x] Red team patches: barrier calculation (2026-01-28)
- [x] Red team patches: coordination constraint grounding (2026-01-28)
