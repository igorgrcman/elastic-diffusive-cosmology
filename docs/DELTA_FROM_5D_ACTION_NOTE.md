# δ from 5D Action: Executive Summary

**Created:** 2026-01-29
**Source:** `edc_papers/_shared/derivations/delta_from_5d_action_proton_scale.tex`
**Status:** [Dc] — Derived Conditional (proton identification is postulate)

---

## Main Result

```
δ = ℏ/(2 m_p c) = 0.533 GeV⁻¹ = 0.105 fm
```

**In words:** The brane thickness is half the proton Compton wavelength.

---

## Derivation Chain

1. **5D action → 1D mode equation** [Der]: KK reduction gives -d²w/dχ² + V(χ)w = λw
2. **Potential scaling** [Dc]: Depth V₀ ~ 1/δ², width ~ δ
3. **Ground state energy** [Der]: E₀ ~ 1/δ (quantum mechanics)
4. **Proton = bound mode** [P]: Postulate identifying proton with localized fermion
5. **Match m_p = E₀** [Dc]: Gives δ = 1/(2m_p)

---

## Assumptions (Explicit)

1. Thick brane structure [P]
2. Proton identified as bound fermionic mode [P]
3. Single-scale dominance [Dc]
4. Harmonic approximation for coefficient [Dc]

## What Is Derived

- δ ~ 1/m_p scaling [Dc]
- Coefficient c_δ = 1/2 (approximate) [Dc]
- Numerical value δ = 0.533 GeV⁻¹ [Dc]

---

## What Remains Open

- Potential shape V(χ) from 5D action (currently ansatz)
- Exact coefficient (why 1/2 vs 1/3 vs 1/π)
- Proton mass derivation (currently input)
- Topological justification for proton = bound mode

---

## Verdict

**Status:** YELLOW [Dc] — Principled but model-dependent

**Upgrade path to GREEN:** Derive V(χ) explicitly; compute exact bound state; justify proton identification from topology.
