# Israel Z_N Anchors Note

**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Source:** `edc_papers/_shared/derivations/israel_zn_fixed_points_anchors.tex`
**Status:** [Der] for identical anchors; [Dc] for λ prefactor

## What Was Derived

**Identical Anchors [Der]:**
- Z_N symmetry ⇒ stress-energy equal at all fixed points
- Equal stress-energy ⇒ τ_n = τ for all n
- Therefore: λ_n = λ (uniform anchor coupling)

**λ Scaling [Dc]:**
- λ = c_λ · κ_5² τ with c_λ ~ O(1)
- Prefactor c_λ not computed (requires bulk EOM)

---

## Key Upgrade

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Identical anchors" assumed [Dc] | "Identical anchors under Z_N symmetry" derived [Der] |
| λ scaling heuristic | λ ∝ κ_5² τ established [Dc] |

---

## Remaining Gaps

- Exact c_λ value (requires full 5D solution)
- W(u) functional form (requires K(u) coupling)
- Bulk field equations NOT solved (by design—out of scope)

## How This Upgrades k-Channel

Complete chain now [Der]:
```
Z_N symmetry → τ_n = τ → λ_n = λ → a/c = 1/N → k(N) = 1 + 1/N
```

Physical credibility of k(6) = 7/6 is significantly strengthened.
