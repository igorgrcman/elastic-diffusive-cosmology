## Description

Technical note establishing the proton as a Y-junction in the 5D membrane framework. Provides the variational foundation for the proton mass and structure.

Key contents:
- Y-junction geometry and topology
- Variational principle for junction stability
- Proton mass from junction energy

This is a **backbone document** referenced by Companions G and H.
