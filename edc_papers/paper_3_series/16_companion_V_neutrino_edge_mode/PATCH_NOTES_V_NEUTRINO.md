# Patch Notes: Companion V — Neutrino as Boundary/Edge Mode

## Version 0.1 (2026-01-20)

### New Content

1. **Neutrino Ontology (§2)**
   - Interfacial zone definition [Def]
   - Edge mode characterization [P]/[Def]
   - Key distinction from "bulk escape"

2. **Ledger Role (§3)**
   - Table: neutrino contributions in representative decays
   - Chirality and helicity [P]/[Dc]
   - "Suppressed leakage" language precision

3. **Chirality Filter (§6)**
   - Chiral projection operator P_chir [P]/[Def]
   - V−A consistency as output, not input
   - Falsifiability handles

4. **Figures**
   - fig_neutrino_localization.tex: interfacial zone with neutrino
   - fig_chirality_filter.tex: BC-based chirality selection

5. **Falsifiability (§5)**
   - Four testable predictions
   - Open questions table with observable handles
