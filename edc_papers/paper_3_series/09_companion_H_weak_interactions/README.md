## Description

Technical note modeling weak interactions as transitions between 5D junction configurations. Establishes the thick-brane microphysics foundation for the EDC treatment of beta decay.

Key contents:
- Junction transition formalism
- Thick-brane corrections
- Connection to neutron lifetime calculation
