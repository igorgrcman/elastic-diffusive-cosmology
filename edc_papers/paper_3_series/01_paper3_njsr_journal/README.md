# Neutron Lifetime from 5D Membrane Cosmology

**Paper 3 (NJSR Journal Format)**


---

## Description

Main research paper deriving the neutron lifetime from 5D membrane cosmology. Uses WKB tunneling through a barrier in the collective coordinate connecting neutron and proton brane configurations.

Key results:
- tau_n derived within 1% of experimental value (878.4 s)
- No Standard Model G_F as input
- Single calibrated parameter (barrier height V_B)
