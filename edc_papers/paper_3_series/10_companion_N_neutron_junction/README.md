## Description

Technical note establishing the neutron as an excited 5D junction state within Elastic Diffusive Cosmology (EDC). The neutron shares the same three-arm junction topology as the proton (Companion F), but is displaced from the local Steiner minimum.

Key contents:
- Neutron ontology: same topology as proton, different energy state
- Collective coordinate $q$ measuring departure from Steiner symmetry
- Thick-brane pumping and dissipation pathway
- Frozen projection boundary organizing weak outputs
- Connection to Paper 3's WKB treatment

This is a **backbone document** for the neutron, analogous to Companion F for the proton.
