# Companion L: Electron as Brane Defect

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial Draft)
**Date:** 2026-01-20
**DOI:** [To be reserved]

## Purpose

This companion establishes the electron's ontological status within the EDC
framework: a stable, observer-facing brane-layer defect that emerges as an
allowed output of the frozen projection operator.

## Key Concepts

1. **Electron Ontology [P]/[Def]:** Observer-facing brane defect, localized at
   y ≈ 0
2. **Absorption Channel [Dc]/[P]:** Energy from bulk trigger (e.g., neutron
   junction relaxation) enters brane and projects to electron
3. **Selection Rules [Dc]:** Kinematic access (Q > m_e) + ledger closure +
   chirality filter

## Exit Criteria (v0.1)

- [x] Ontology of electron as observer-facing brane-layer defect
- [x] Absorption channel narrative (beta⁻ as primary test)
- [x] Selection-rule discussion (why e⁻, not μ⁻/τ⁻)
- [x] 2 TikZ figures + 1 selection table + 1 falsifiability box
- [ ] Clean build

## What This Does NOT Do

- Does NOT derive m_e = 0.511 MeV (mass origin [OPEN])
- Does NOT explain mass hierarchy m_μ/m_e ≈ 207 ([OPEN])
- Does NOT derive electron spin from first principles (spin-1/2 is [BL])
