# Patch Notes: Companion L — Electron as Brane Defect

## Version 0.1 (2026-01-20)

### New Content

1. **Electron Ontology (§2)**
   - Definition: observer-facing brane-layer defect [P]/[Def]
   - Three-layer brane picture (bulk-facing, internal, observer-facing)
   - Localization at y ≈ 0

2. **Absorption Channel (§3)**
   - Beta⁻ decay as primary test case
   - Energy budget: Q_β = 1.293 MeV [BL]
   - Four-step narrative: trigger → absorption → selection → projection

3. **Selection Rules (§4)**
   - Definition: kinematic + ledger + chirality
   - Table: why e⁻ allowed, μ⁻/τ⁻ forbidden
   - Preview of chirality filter (full treatment in Companion V)

4. **Figures**
   - fig_electron_localization.tex: brane-layer structure with electron
   - fig_selection_pipeline.tex: selection rule flow diagram

5. **Falsifiability (§5)**
   - Three testable predictions
   - Open questions table with observable handles

### Epistemic Status

| Claim | Status |
|-------|--------|
