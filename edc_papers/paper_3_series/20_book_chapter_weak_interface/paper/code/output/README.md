# Auto-Generated Output Files

This directory contains **auto-generated** `.tex` files produced by BVP solver scripts.

## Files

| File | Generator | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `bvp_halfline_phase_table.tex` | `code/bvp_halfline_phase.py` | Phase portrait data for half-line BVP |
| `bvp_halfline_toy_table.tex` | `code/bvp_halfline_toy.py` | Toy model solutions |

## Notation Status

These files may contain **legacy z-notation** for the 5D coordinate.
Since they are regenerated by scripts, notation updates should be made
in the **generator scripts**, not in these output files directly.

To update notation:
1. Edit the corresponding Python script in `code/`
2. Re-run the script to regenerate the `.tex` output
3. The new output will reflect the updated notation

## Not in Build Graph

These files are **NOT** compiled into the main document (`EDC_Part_II_Weak_Sector.tex`).
They serve as:
- Numerical verification data
- Supporting material for the BVP closure chapter
- Reference tables for future development
