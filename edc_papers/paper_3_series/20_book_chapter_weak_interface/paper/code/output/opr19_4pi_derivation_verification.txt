OPR-19 4π Coefficient Derivation Verification
=============================================
Date: 2026-01-22

NO-SMUGGLING STATUS: VERIFIED

INPUTS:
  σ r_e² = 5.856 MeV [Dc]
  r_e = 1.0 fm [P]
  ℏc = 197.3 MeV·fm [BL]

ROUTE 1 (Gauge Convention):
  Key: Gauss's law → ∫dΩ = 4π [Dc]
  Matching: V(r_e) = σ r_e² [P]
  Result: C = 4π

ROUTE 2 (Isotropy):
  Key: Spherical symmetry on brane [P]
  Mode normalization on S² → Area = 4πr²
  Result: C = 4π

CONVERGENCE: YES (both routes give C = 4π)

DERIVED VALUES:
  C = 4π = 12.566371
  g² = 0.372979

SM COMPARISON (informational):
  SM g₂² = 0.3970
  Deviation: -6.0%

STATUS: OPR-19 upgrades RED-C [OPEN] → YELLOW [Dc]+[P]
