----------------------------------------
FORBIDDEN as inputs to define ℓ, x₁, or R_ξ:
  ✗ M_W = 80 GeV
  ✗ G_F = 1.17 × 10⁻⁵ GeV⁻²
  ✗ g₂ (SM weak coupling)
  ✗ v = 246 GeV

ALLOWED:
  ✓ R_ξ ~ 10⁻³ fm from Part I [P]

==============================================================================

PART 1: R_ξ INTERPRETATION ANALYSIS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Input: R_ξ = 0.001 fm [P] (from Part I diffusion)
       x₁ = π/2 = 1.570796 [Dc] (Neumann-Neumann)

Interpretation                        Factor       ℓ (fm)  m_φ (GeV) Tag       
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A1: R_ξ = ℓ (radius as length)        1.0000     0.001000     309.96 [P]       
A2: ℓ = 2πR_ξ (circumference)         6.2832     0.006283      49.33 [Dc]      
A3: ℓ = πR_ξ (half-orbifold)          3.1416     0.003142      98.66 [Dc] (neg)
A4: ℓ = 4πR_ξ (solid angle)          12.5664     0.012566      24.67 [Dc] (neg)

Derivation details:
  A1: R_ξ = ℓ (radius as length):
    Derivation: Direct identification: R_ξ is the KK length itself
    Status: Non-standard; requires redefining R_ξ as circumference

  A2: ℓ = 2πR_ξ (circumference):
    Derivation: R_ξ is radius; KK uses circumference L = 2πR
    Status: DERIVED: Standard circle geometry

  A3: ℓ = πR_ξ (half-orbifold):
    Derivation: Fundamental domain of S¹/Z₂ is half-circle
    Status: NEGATIVE CLOSURE: x₁ already accounts for orbifold

  A4: ℓ = 4πR_ξ (solid angle):
    Derivation: 3D isotropic solid angle
    Status: NEGATIVE CLOSURE: Wrong dimension (3D not 1D)

PART 2: COMBINED FACTOR ANALYSIS (with independence check)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PART 3: RESIDUAL ANALYSIS (comparison to M_W [BL] only)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: M_W = 80 GeV is [BL] comparison ONLY, not an input for derivation.

Best derived factor: 2π√2 = 8.8858 [Dc]
Resulting m_φ: 34.88 GeV
Comparison to M_W = 80.4 GeV [BL]:
  Deviation: -56.6%
  Factor needed to hit M_W: 2.3049

PART 4: MISSING FACTOR (to convert 2π√2 → 8)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MISSING FACTOR ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------
Current best factor: 2π√2 = 8.885766
Target factor: 8
Missing factor: 8 / (2π√2) = 0.900316

Algebraic form:
  8 / (2π√2) = 4 / (π√2) = 2√2 / π
  Numeric: 0.900316

Simple candidate comparison:
  9/10            = 0.900000  (diff: 0.04%)
  π/√(12)         = 0.906900  (diff: 0.73%)
  √(2)/√(π)       = 0.797885  (diff: 11.38%)
  1 - 0.1         = 0.900000  (diff: 0.04%)
  e^(-0.1)        = 0.904837  (diff: 0.50%)

==============================================================================
ATTEMPT E VERDICT
==============================================================================

TRACK A (2π derivation):
  ✓ R_ξ is the radius of the compact dimension
  ✓ KK quantization uses circumference ℓ = 2πR_ξ
  ✓ Factor 2π is now [Dc], upgraded from [P]
  ✓ Alternative factors (1, π, 4π) negatively closed [Dc]

TRACK B (0.9003 residual):
  ✗ No unique derivation of the missing factor
  ✗ Candidates exist but all require new parameters [P]
  ✗ Residual remains [OPEN]

COMBINED RESULT:
  Best factor: 2π√2 = 8.8858 [Dc]
  Result: m_φ = 34.88 GeV
  Residual vs M_W: -56.6% [BL comparison]

STATUS: OPR-20 partial upgrade
  - 2π factor: [P] → [Dc]
  - 2π√2 combined: [Dc] (all components derived)
  - Exact factor 8: remains [OPEN]
  - Overall: RED-C [Dc]+[OPEN]
