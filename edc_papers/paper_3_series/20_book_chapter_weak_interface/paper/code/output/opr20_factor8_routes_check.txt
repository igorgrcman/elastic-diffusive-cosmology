VERDICT
======================================================================

DERIVED FACTORS [Dc]:
  • Route A (Z₂): factor 2
  • Route C (Junction): factor 2
  • Route D1 (2π): factor 6.28 — closest single derived factor to 8
  • Route E2 (Z₂ × norm): factor 4

FACTOR 8 STATUS:
  • No SINGLE derived route gives exactly 8
  • Combined C3 (2×2×2=8): requires third Z₂ factor [P]
  • Combined C4 (2×4=8): may involve overcounting

CLOSEST DERIVED FACTORS:
  • Combined C4: 2 × 4 = 8: factor 8.00 (0.0% from 8)
  • Combined C2: 2π × √2 ≈ 8.89: factor 8.89 (11.1% from 8)
  • Route D4: Sphere volume coefficient (4π/3): factor 4.19 (47.6% from 8)

RECOMMENDED PATH:
  1. Use 2π (circumference) [Dc]: gives m_φ ≈ 99 GeV (24% above 80 GeV)
  2. Factor 8 requires [P] postulate (third Z₂ or specific combination)
  3. Exact factor 8 is numeric match, NOT uniquely derived

OPR-20 STATUS: RED-C [Dc]+[OPEN]
  [Dc]: Standard BC route negative closure; Z₂, 2π factors derived
  [OPEN]: Factor 8 not uniquely derivable without additional [P] assumption
