Elastic Diffusive Cosmology — Part II: Weak Sector

This is Part II of the Elastic Diffusive Cosmology (EDC) series, focusing on the geometric origin of weak interactions within a unified 5D membrane framework.

FRAMEWORK 2.0 READING CONVENTION
All physical processes are presented as "5D bulk+brane cause → 3D observational shadow." Standard Model terminology appears only as shorthand for 3D descriptions, not as fundamental explanations.

KEY CONTENT
- Frozen Regime Foundations: Why particles are "frozen configurations" (step-function profiles) rather than Ginzburg-Landau vortices. Derivation of m_p/m_e = 6π⁵ and α = (4π + 5/6)/6π⁵.
- Z6 Program: Mathematical proofs for proton stability, Steiner angles, and color confinement from hexagonal lattice symmetry.
- Electroweak Sector: Derivation of sin²θ_W from Z6 geometry, Fermi coupling, V-A structure from 5D chiral localization.
- Work Packages: BVP solver specification for thick-brane mode problems, open problem tracking (OPR register).

EPISTEMIC TRANSPARENCY
Every claim carries an explicit evidence tag: [BL] (baseline/measured), [Dc] (derived conditional), [P] (postulated), [I] (identified), [M] (mathematical theorem), [OPEN] (not yet resolved). The derivation chain from postulates to predictions is fully traceable.

RELATIONSHIP TO PART I
Part I establishes the 5D membrane action and derives the fundamental geometric structure. Part II extends this to weak interactions, treating Part I results as input and developing the weak-sector phenomenology.
