# Baseline sources used in code

This repository uses **baseline reference values** from:
- PDG Physical Constants (2020 review; Revised 2019): mp/me, sin^2(theta_hat)(MZ) in MS-bar, mW, mZ, and the PDG footnote for sin^2(theta_eff).
- NIST Fundamental Physical Constants: sin^2(theta_W).

These are used for comparison only; they are **not** treated as EDC-derived results.
