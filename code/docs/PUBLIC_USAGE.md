# Public usage notes

This repository accompanies the **Elastic Diffusive Cosmology (EDC)** book.

- The `scripts/` folder contains runnable demonstrations and verification harnesses.
- Some scripts use **baseline constants** (CODATA/PDG/NIST) strictly as references.
- A passing check demonstrates **internal consistency** under stated assumptions.
- Independent prediction claims require EDC-derived inputs and mappings.

For running instructions, see:
- `README.md`
- `scripts/README.md`
