FROZEN ON BRANE VIA ξ-BC: VERDICT
==================================

Q1: Does "frozen on brane via BC" exist as a derived stiff limit?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
YES [Der]. Dirichlet BC emerges as λ→∞ limit of pinning potential V=½λ(Φ-v)².
Derived from action variation (Section 02).

Q2: Does it change interaction mechanism enough to create minimum in V_lin(d)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO [Der]. All BC scenarios (Neumann, Robin, Dirichlet) give V'_lin(d) > 0.
The linearized potential remains monotonically increasing.
BC affect mode spectrum but NOT sign structure.

Q3: Does minimum still rely on core overlap/topology?
-----------------------------------------------------
YES [Der]. Minimum comes from:
  - V_core → +∞ as d → 0  [from RADIAL-frozen core, Theorem 2]
  - V_lin → +∞ as d → ∞   [from log/K₀ growth]
  - Continuity → minimum at d₀

BC provide scale δ and mode spectrum, NOT the minimum mechanism.

KEY DISTINCTION:
================
RADIAL-FROZEN f(r)=Θ(r-a): Creates core energy, resolves no-go, ESSENTIAL.
BRANE-FROZEN (ξ-BC):       Affects modes, does NOT resolve no-go, HELPFUL.

UPDATED EPISTEMIC CHAIN:
========================
[P]   A1-A5: 5D geometry + scalar field
[Dc]  Topological defects exist (π₁)
[Der] BC from action: Neumann/Robin/Dirichlet (Section 02)
[Der] Mode spectrum under BC (Section 03)
[Der] V'_lin > 0 for all BC (Section 05) — NO ATTRACTION FROM BC
[Der] V_core → +∞ as d → 0 (topology, Theorem 2 — requires radial-frozen)
[Dc]  V_lin → +∞ as d → ∞ (log growth)
[Dc]  Minimum exists (continuity, Theorem 3)
[P]   d₀ ~ δ (NOT derived)

BOTTOM LINE:
============
"BC create attraction" is FALSE.
Minimum mechanism is TOPOLOGICAL (radial-frozen core), not BC.
Chapter 2's radial-frozen approach is VALIDATED and ESSENTIAL.
