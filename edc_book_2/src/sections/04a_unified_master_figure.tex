\subsection{Master Diagram: One Interface Pipeline, Multiple Ontological Sources}
\label{sec:master_diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig:master_pipeline} summarizes the EDC weak-sector story in a single view.
It shows:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item[(i)] The \emph{common} Absorption--Dissipation--Release pipeline
  \item[(ii)] The \emph{ontology-dependent} origin of pumping/excitation
  \item[(iii)] The \emph{kinematic gates} that determine which observer-facing
        outputs are allowed
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]

\input{figures/fig_master_weak_pipeline.tex}
\caption{\textbf{Unified weak-sector pipeline.}
All cases share the same interface skeleton (Absorption $\to$ Dissipation $\to$ Release),
but differ in their ontology (bulk-core junction vs brane-dominant defect vs composite
junction-pair vs edge mode). The energy gate $\mathcal{P}_{\text{energy}}$ enforces
kinematic allowance: channels whose rest-mass threshold exceeds the available $Q$-value
are forbidden at leading order (e.g., neutron cannot emit $\mu$ because
$m_\mu \approx 106$ MeV $\gg Q_n \approx 0.78$ MeV).}

\subsection{Kinematic Gates and Output Allowance}
\label{sec:kinematic_gates}

\subsubsection{Why ``Forbidden'' Means Kinematically Closed}

Throughout this chapter, ``forbidden'' is used in the strict kinematic sense:
the channel is closed because the available $Q$-value is below the rest-mass
threshold required to create the product. \textbf{No additional dynamical
assumption is needed for such a closure.}

This is important: when we say ``$\mathcal{P}_{\text{energy}}$ forbids the
$\mu$ channel,'' we mean that the energy gate simply blocks a rest-mass
threshold that is orders of magnitude too high. This is not a metaphysical
prohibition---it is arithmetic.

\subsubsection{Gate Summary Table}

\begin{table}[ht]

\caption{\textbf{Kinematic gate summary across weak-sector case studies.}
``Allowed'' means kinematically open at leading order; branching ratios are
not derived here. All values are \tagBL{}.}
\label{tab:gates}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Case} & \textbf{Available scale} & \textbf{Threshold test} &
\textbf{Allowed output} \\
\midrule
Neutron $n \to p + \cdots$ & $Q_n \approx 0.782$ MeV &
$m_\ell c^2 \le Q_n$ & $e^-$ only; $\mu$ forbidden \\
Muon $\mu \to \cdots$ & $m_\mu c^2 \approx 106$ MeV &
$m_\ell c^2 \le m_\mu c^2$ & $e^-$ (lightest defect) \\
Tau $\tau \to \cdots$ & $m_\tau c^2 \approx 1777$ MeV &
multiple thresholds & $e^-$, $\mu^-$, hadrons \\
Pion $\pi \to \ell\nu$ & $m_\pi c^2 \approx 140$ MeV &
helicity/BC suppression & $\mu$ dominates; $e$ suppressed \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{The Neutron Example in Full Sentences}

In neutron beta decay, the total energy available to the leptonic sector is the
$Q$-value:
\begin{equation}
Q_n = (m_n - m_p - m_e)c^2 \approx 0.782~\text{MeV},
\label{eq:Qn_value}
\end{equation}
so any channel requiring production of a heavier charged lepton is closed.

Because $m_\mu c^2 \approx 105.7$ MeV $\gg Q_n$, a neutron \emph{cannot} produce
a muon in ordinary decay. This is the precise meaning of ``$\mathcal{P}_{\text{energy}}$
forbids the $\mu$ channel'': the energy gate blocks a rest-mass threshold that is
more than 100 times too high.

\begin{tcolorbox}[mechanism, title={Q-Gate for Neutron Decay}]
\textbf{Kinematic gate} \tagBL{}/\tagDc{}:
\begin{align}
Q_\beta(e) &= m_n - m_p - m_e = 1.293 - 0.511 = 0.782~\text{MeV} > 0
  && \Rightarrow \text{OPEN} \\
Q_\beta(\mu) &= m_n - m_p - m_\mu = 1.293 - 105.66 = -104.4~\text{MeV} < 0
  && \Rightarrow \text{CLOSED}
\end{align}

The electron channel is kinematically allowed; the muon channel is kinematically
forbidden. This is baseline physics, not an EDC-specific claim.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{What the Gates Tell Us}

The gate structure demonstrates that:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item \textbf{Channel selection is kinematic}: Neutron $\to$ electron (not muon)
        because $Q_\beta(\mu) < 0$.
  \item \textbf{Mode overlap matters separately}: Muon $\to$ leptons only because
        $\mathcal{P}_{\text{mode}}$ forbids hadronic channels (not kinematics).
  \item \textbf{Chirality suppression is real but distinct}: Pion $\to$ muon
        dominates over electron by $(m_\mu/m_e)^2$ due to
        $\mathcal{P}_{\text{chir}}$ (boundary conditions).
  \item \textbf{Electron stability is structural}: No lower charged mode exists,
        so all gates are blocked.
\end{enumerate}

These are \emph{facts} that EDC must be consistent with; they are not EDC-derived
claims. The EDC contribution is to interpret these gates as projections in the
thick-brane interface picture.
