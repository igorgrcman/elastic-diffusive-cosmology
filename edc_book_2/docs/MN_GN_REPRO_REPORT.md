## Reproduction Commands

### Method 1: Run Original Producer Script

```bash
cd elastic-diffusive-cosmology_repo/edc_book_2
python src/derivations/frustration_geiger_nuttall.py
```

**Expected output (key line):**
```
Improvement: 44.7%
```

### Method 2: Run Comparison Harness

```bash
cd elastic-diffusive-cosmology_repo
python edc_papers/_shared/mn_gn_audit/compare_models.py
```

**Expected output (key line):**
```
>>> IMPROVEMENT: 44.7% <<<
```

### Method 3: Run Full Reproduction Script

```bash
cd elastic-diffusive-cosmology_repo
bash edc_papers/_shared/mn_gn_audit/repro_commands.sh
```

**This will:**
1. Print git hash and Python version
2. Run the original producer script
3. Run the comparison harness
4. Extract the key result
