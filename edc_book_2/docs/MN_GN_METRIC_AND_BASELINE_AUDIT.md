# MN/Geiger-Nuttall Metric and Baseline Audit

**Generated:** 2026-01-29
**Audit:** Precise definition of "44.7% improvement" claim

## The Claim

> **"44.7% improvement in mean absolute error over standard Geiger-Nuttall"**

---

## METRIC DEFINITION

### What is "44.7%"?

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Metric | **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** |
| Target variable | **log₁₀(t½)** (not t½ directly) |
| Dataset | Full dataset (21 nuclei, no train/test split) |
| Improvement formula | `(MAE_baseline - MAE_new) / MAE_baseline × 100%` |

### Exact Calculation

```python
MAE_baseline = 0.5562  # Standard Geiger-Nuttall
MAE_edc = 0.3078       # Frustration-corrected

improvement = (0.5562 - 0.3078) / 0.5562 * 100
            = 0.2484 / 0.5562 * 100
            = 44.66%
            ≈ 44.7%
```

## BASELINE DEFINITION ("CURRENT")

### Standard Geiger-Nuttall Law

**Formula:**
```
log₁₀(t½) = slope × (Z / √Q) + intercept
```

**Fitted coefficients:**
| Parameter | Value | How obtained |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| slope | 1.4348 | Least-squares fit to 21 nuclei |
| intercept | -46.8164 | Least-squares fit to 21 nuclei |

**Degrees of freedom:** 2 (slope, intercept)

**R²:** 0.9822

**Code implementation:**
```python
# frustration_geiger_nuttall.py, lines 109-112
slope_std, intercept_std = np.polyfit(x1, log_t, 1)
log_t_pred_std = slope_std * x1 + intercept_std
R2_std = np.corrcoef(log_t, log_t_pred_std)[0,1]**2
```

## EDC MODEL DEFINITION

### Frustration-Corrected Geiger-Nuttall Law

**Formula:**
```
log₁₀(t½) = a × (Z / √Q) + c × εf + b
```

**Fitted coefficients:**
| Parameter | Value | Physical meaning |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| a | 1.6286 | Geiger-Nuttall coefficient |
| c | -2.4017 | Frustration coefficient (negative = faster decay) |
| b | -42.1277 | Intercept |

**Degrees of freedom:** 3 (a, c, b)

**R²:** 0.9941

**Code implementation:**
```python
# frustration_geiger_nuttall.py, lines 114-120
X = np.column_stack([x1, eps_f_arr, np.ones(len(x1))])
coeffs, _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(X, log_t, rcond=None)
a, c, b = coeffs
```

## FAIRNESS CHECK

| Property | Baseline | EDC Model | Fair? |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Dataset | 21 nuclei | 21 nuclei | ✓ Same |
| Fit procedure | Least squares | Least squares | ✓ Same |
| Degrees of freedom | 2 | 3 | ⚠ EDC has +1 |
| Refit | Yes | Yes | ✓ Same |

**Note:** The EDC model has one additional degree of freedom (the frustration coefficient c). This is expected for a model adding a new physical term. The improvement is not due to overfitting: adjusted R² also improves.

## ALL METRICS COMPARISON

| Metric | Baseline | EDC | Improvement |
|--------|----------|-----|-------------|
| R² | 0.9822 | 0.9941 | +1.18 pp |
| **MAE(log₁₀t)** | **0.5562** | **0.3078** | **+44.7%** |
| RMSE(log₁₀t) | 0.8441 | 0.4875 | +42.3% |
| MedAE(log₁₀t) | 0.3106 | 0.2500 | +19.5% |

---

## WHAT "CURRENT" MEANS

The baseline is the **standard Geiger-Nuttall law**, fitted fresh to the same 21-nucleus dataset.

It is NOT:
- ❌ A previous EDC model
- ❌ A literature benchmark with fixed coefficients
- ❌ Viola-Seaborg formula
- ❌ Any cross-validated result
