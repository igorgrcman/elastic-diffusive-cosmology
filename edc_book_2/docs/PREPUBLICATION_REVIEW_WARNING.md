# Pre-Publication Review Warning — EDC Book 2

**Created:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** ACTIVE — Book 2 is NOT publication-final

---

## Warning

**Book 2 is not publication-final.**

Before any public release, the following must be completed:

1. **Full narrative/claim audit** — Every claim must be verified against current derivation status
2. **Decide what to publish** — Not all working material belongs in a public document
3. **Ensure strict epistemic tagging** — All [Der], [Dc], [I], [P], [Cal], [BL] tags must be accurate
4. **Remove internal-only notes** — Working comments, debug boxes, and speculative asides must be reviewed
5. **Verify all cross-references** — Equation labels, section refs, and box labels must resolve correctly

---

## Insertion Boxes

All insertion boxes (tcolorbox elements with status summaries) are **working notes** until the pre-publication review is complete. They:

- Track current understanding
- Flag open problems
- Provide epistemic guardrails

They are NOT final text intended for readers unfamiliar with the development process.

- [ ] All RED status items either resolved or explicitly marked as "future work"
