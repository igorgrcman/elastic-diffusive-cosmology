# TODO.md — Prioritized Action Items

**Last updated:** 2026-01-28

## Priority 1: Blocking Issues

- [ ] **Resolve L₀/δ tension** — Why does static prefer π², dynamic prefers 9.33?
  - Possible: quantum/boundary corrections for dynamic processes
  - Need: explicit calculation from 5D action

- [ ] **Derive prefactor A** from fluctuation determinant
  - Current: A ≈ 0.84 [Cal]
  - Need: [Der] from instanton fluctuation modes

- [ ] **Derive G_F without circular input**
  - Current: uses measured v
  - Need: pure 5D derivation of weak coupling

---

## Priority 2: Model Completion

- [ ] **Derive geometric factor f = √(δ/L₀)** from first principles
  - Current: [I] — identified from penetration depth argument
  - Need: [Der] from contact mechanics in 5D

- [ ] **Derive frustration energy ε_f(A)** from 5D action
  - Current: phenomenological interpolation
  - Need: topological calculation

- [ ] **Include spin/isospin** in topological pinning model
  - Current: single deformation parameter q
  - Need: proper Pauli exclusion treatment

---

## Priority 3: Documentation & Consistency

- [ ] **Create comprehensive derivation registry**
  - List all claims with epistemic status
  - Track dependencies

- [ ] **Audit all "~20%" vs "<1%" claims**
  - Ensure consistency between documents
  - Mark calibrated vs derived results clearly

- [ ] **Update turning points document**
  - Add frustration-corrected G-N law results
  - Add red team patches

---

## Priority 4: Extensions

- [ ] **Connect to drip lines** — topological origin of nuclear stability limits
- [ ] **Test superheavy predictions** — compare with experimental data when available
- [ ] **Investigate QCD duality** — is topological pinning dual to lattice QCD?
