## Producer Scripts (Compute the 44.7% Number)

| Script | Location | Status | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| `frustration_geiger_nuttall.py` | `src/derivations/` | **Primary** | Fits both standard and frustration-corrected G-N laws, computes improvement |

### Key Functions in Producer Script

```python
def frustration_energy(A):
    """Calculate frustration energy per nucleon for nucleus of mass A."""
    # Lines 44-62

def fit_frustration_geiger_nuttall():
    """Fit the frustration-corrected Geiger-Nuttall law."""
    # Lines 97-132
    # Returns dict with: a, c, b, R2_std, R2_frust, mean_err_std, mean_err_frust, improvement
```

---

## Support Scripts

None identified. The producer script is self-contained.

## LaTeX Source Documents

| Document | Location | Purpose |
