# REPRO Pack Requirements — Book 2
# Minimal dependencies for reproducibility scripts
#
# Note: Scripts are designed to work with Python standard library only.
# These packages are optional for enhanced output/analysis.

# No external dependencies required for core REPRO scripts
# Python 3.8+ standard library is sufficient

# Optional (for extended features):
# numpy>=1.20.0     # If numerical arrays needed
# scipy>=1.7.0      # If ODE/BVP solvers needed
