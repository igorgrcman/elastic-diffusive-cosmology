# PR-OPR-GAPS: OPR Numbering Audit

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Branch:** book2-peerreview-verification-remediation-v1
**Triggered by:** Peer review claim of "missing OPR-02,04,05,06,07,08,17,18"

---

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT: REVIEWER CLAIM INCORRECT**

The OPR Registry contains **all** numbers from OPR-01 through OPR-15 with no gaps. The reviewer's claim is factually wrong.

## Evidence: Complete OPR Listing

| OPR | Category | Short Name | Status |
|-----|----------|------------|--------|
| OPR-01 | [C] | σ anchor | OPEN |
| OPR-02 | [A/B] | Robin α from action | PARTIAL |
| OPR-03 | [T] | π₁(M⁵) topology closure | OPEN |
| OPR-04 | [B] | δ ≡ R_ξ teleport | OPEN |
| OPR-05 | [B/C] | m_φ teleport | OPEN |
| OPR-06 | [C] | P_bulk anchor | OPEN |
| OPR-07 | [N] | Physics-grade numerics | STRONG PARTIAL |
| OPR-08 | [X] | sin²θ_W chain/notation | **CLOSED** |
| OPR-09 | [L] | π prefactor derivation | OPEN |
| OPR-10 | [L] | (3/2) factor from Z₆ | OPEN |
| OPR-11 | [L] | Koide Q = 2/3 energetics | OPEN |
| OPR-12 | [L] | KK truncation / V(ξ) potential | OPEN |
| OPR-13 | [N] | PMNS mixing angles | YELLOW PARTIAL |
| OPR-14 | [N] | CP phase δ derivation | OPEN |
| OPR-15 | [N] | Dirac/Majorana determination | OPEN |

**Total: 15 OPRs, consecutively numbered, no gaps.**

## Analysis of Reviewer Claims

### Claimed "Missing" OPRs

| Claimed Missing | Actual Status |
|-----------------|---------------|
| OPR-02 | EXISTS — Robin α from action (PARTIAL) |
| OPR-04 | EXISTS — δ ≡ R_ξ teleport (OPEN) |
| OPR-05 | EXISTS — m_φ teleport (OPEN) |
| OPR-06 | EXISTS — P_bulk anchor (OPEN) |
| OPR-07 | EXISTS — Physics-grade numerics (STRONG PARTIAL) |
| OPR-08 | EXISTS — sin²θ_W chain/notation (CLOSED) |
| OPR-17 | NEVER EXISTED — Registry ends at OPR-15 |
| OPR-18 | NEVER EXISTED — Registry ends at OPR-15 |

### Possible Explanation for Reviewer Confusion

1. **Old document version**: Reviewer may have seen an earlier draft before OPR-02 through OPR-08 were added
2. **Different file**: May have looked at a different OPR listing (not the authoritative registry)
3. **Misreading table**: The table format may have been misinterpreted

## Registry Source

**Authoritative file:** `edc_book_2/canon/opr/OPR_REGISTRY.md`
**Status:** CANON
**Last updated:** 2026-01-25
**Total OPRs:** 15 (OPR-01 through OPR-15)

---

## Conclusion

**No patch required for OPR numbering.**

The Open Problem Registry is complete with consecutive numbering OPR-01 through OPR-15. The reviewer's claim of "missing" OPRs is factually incorrect.

**Note:** OPR-17 and OPR-18 were never defined because the registry intentionally ends at OPR-15. If future work requires additional OPRs, they would be added as OPR-16, OPR-17, etc.
