# PR-RXI: Verdict

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Branch:** book2-peerreview-verification-remediation-v1

---

## Summary

| Aspect | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Claimed issue | 15 OOM conflict (10⁻³⁵ m vs 10⁻²⁰ m) |
| Book2 reality | All R_ξ values are ~10⁻³ fm = 10⁻¹⁸ m |
| Conflict exists? | **NO** (in Book2) |
| Patch required? | **NO** |

---

## Resolution

The peer review claim of "R_ξ magnitude conflict" **does not apply to Book2**.

### What Book2 Does Correctly

1. **Consistent numeric value:** All R_ξ ~ 10⁻³ fm
2. **Proper epistemic tagging:** R_ξ marked as [P] (inherited from Part I)
3. **Explicit conditionality:** δ = R_ξ identification clearly labeled as postulate
4. **Source attribution:** "from Part I" stated where relevant

### What May Be True in Part I (Out of Scope)

The reviewer may have found conflicting R_ξ derivations in Part I (Framework v2.0). If so, that is a Part I issue, not a Book2 issue. Book2 simply inherits the value and properly tags the dependency.

---

## Recommendation

**No changes to Book2 R_ξ content.**

If Part I has internal conflicts, those should be addressed in Part I. Book2's treatment is correct for a document that inherits parameters from a prior work.
