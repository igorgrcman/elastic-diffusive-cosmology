## Tag Distribution Analysis

- **High [BL] count (92)**: CH1 establishes baseline SM facts before introducing EDC interpretation
- **High [P] count (99)**: Many postulated mechanisms in EDC weak sector model
- **Moderate [Dc] count (59)**: Conditional derivations (if postulates hold, then...)
- **Low [Der] count (2)**: Few fully derived results without conditions

## Known Gaps

1. **[OPEN] Missing [Der] for key results**: Many [Dc] claims need full derivation path
2. **[OPEN] Cross-chapter dependencies**: Some claims reference results from other chapters
3. **[OPEN] Numerical verification**: Claimed values need computational check
