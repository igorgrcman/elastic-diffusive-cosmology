Generated: 2026-01-24
Status: OPEN

These items require evidence trail or content changes that cannot be done mechanically.

## TODO-001: PDG 2024 Verification

**Closure criterion**: All [BL] values in CH1 compared against PDG 2024; discrepancies documented or corrected.

**Files affected**: All CH1 section files with [BL] tags (92 claims)

**Evidence needed**: PDG 2024 reference document or live check

---

## TODO-002: Derivation Chain Documentation

**Closure criterion**: For each [Dc] claim, trace back to postulates or identify as actually [P].

**Files affected**: All CH1 section files with [Dc] tags (59 claims)

**Evidence needed**: Cross-reference to existing derivation documents in `derivations/` or create new derivation notes.

---

## TODO-003: Dimensional Analysis Pass

**Closure criterion**: Every equation verified for dimensional consistency; document any unit conventions.

**Files affected**: All CH1 section files with equations (~59 blocks)

**Evidence needed**: Analysis document or inline comments

---

## TODO-004: Remaining Unlabeled Equations

**Closure criterion**: Add labels to remaining ~6 unlabeled equations if they are referenceable.

**Files affected**:
- Various inline equations in CH1 files

**Note**: Some equations may intentionally remain unlabeled if they are intermediate steps not meant for cross-reference.
